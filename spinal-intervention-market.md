<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spinal Intervention Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Surgery</li><li>Minimally Invasive Surgery</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The spinal intervention market is primarily divided into two types: open surgery and minimally invasive surgery (MIS). Open surgery involves large incisions and more extensive tissue disruption, typically used for complex spinal conditions. It offers direct access but comes with longer recovery times and increased pain. Conversely, minimally invasive surgery employs smaller incisions and advanced techniques, resulting in reduced tissue damage, shorter hospital stays, and faster recovery, making it increasingly popular for various spinal disorders. Both approaches cater to diverse patient needs.</p></p>
