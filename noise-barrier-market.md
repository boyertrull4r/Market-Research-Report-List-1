<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Noise Barrier Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ground-Mounted Noise Barrier</li><li>Structure-Mounted Noise Barrier</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The noise barrier market is generally categorized into two types: ground-mounted and structure-mounted noise barriers. Ground-mounted noise barriers are installed directly on the ground, often along highways or railways, to absorb and deflect sound from traffic. In contrast, structure-mounted noise barriers are affixed to buildings, bridges, or other structures, providing sound insulation where space is limited. Both types aim to reduce noise pollution, enhancing urban living conditions and protecting residential areas from excessive sound disturbances.</p></p>
