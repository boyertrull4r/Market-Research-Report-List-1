<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cellulase Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>EG</li><li>CBH</li><li>BG</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The cellulase market is segmented into three main types: endoglucanases (EG), cellobiohydrolases (CBH), and β-glucosidases (BG). Endoglucanases (EG) act on the internal bonds of cellulose, promoting chain cleavage and enhancing accessibility. Cellobiohydrolases (CBH) break down cellulosic chains into cellobiose units, thus further reducing polymer length. β-glucosidases (BG) convert cellobiose into glucose, completing the hydrolysis process. Collectively, these enzymes play a crucial role in various applications, including biofuels, textiles, and food processing, by facilitating cellulose degradation.</p></p>
