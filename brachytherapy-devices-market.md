<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Brachytherapy Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High Dose Rate Brachytherapy</li><li>Low Dose Rate Brachytherapy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The brachytherapy devices market is primarily segmented into two types: High Dose Rate (HDR) and Low Dose Rate (LDR) brachytherapy. HDR brachytherapy involves the temporary placement of a radioactive source at the tumor site, delivering high doses of radiation over brief sessions, allowing for outpatient treatment and reduced exposure to medical staff. In contrast, LDR brachytherapy uses small radioactive implants placed directly into or near the tumor, emitting lower radiation doses over an extended period, typically in a hospital setting.</p></p>
